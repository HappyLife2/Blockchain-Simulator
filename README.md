# Blockchain Simulator

A Python-based Blockchain Simulator that demonstrates the fundamental operations of a blockchain. This project aims to provide a simple yet educational insight into how blockchain technology operates at a basic level, including the creation of blocks, handling transactions, implementing a proof-of-work algorithm, and simulating a network of nodes.

## Features

- **Block Creation and Validation**: Demonstrates how new blocks are created, hashed, and added to the blockchain with a valid proof of work.
- **Transaction Handling**: Simulates the creation of transactions and their inclusion within blocks in the blockchain.
- **Proof of Work**: Implements a basic proof of work algorithm to secure the blockchain against fraudulent block creation.
- **Node Simulation**: Provides a rudimentary simulation of nodes in a blockchain network, laying the groundwork for understanding decentralized blockchain networks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3.6 or newer. You can download Python from the official site:

```url
https://www.python.org/downloads/
```

### Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain_simulator.git
cd blockchain_simulator
```

No additional Python packages are required for this project, as it only utilizes the Python Standard Library.

### Running the Simulator

Execute the main script to start the simulator:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
blockchain_simulator/
│
├── blockchain.py         # Core blockchain logic including chain validation and block addition
├── block.py              # Definition of the Block class and related methods
├── transaction.py        # Definition of the Transaction class and transaction verification
├── proof_of_work.py      # Implementation of the Proof of Work algorithm
├── node.py               # Simulates a node in the blockchain network
├── network.py            # Placeholder for network management logic
└── main.py               # Entry point for the simulator, tying all components together
```

## How It Works

- **Blockchain Initialization**: Starts with the creation of a genesis block.
- **Adding Transactions**: New transactions are added to a list of unconfirmed transactions, awaiting inclusion in the next block.
- **Mining a Block**: A new block containing unconfirmed transactions is created and added to the chain after a valid proof of work is found.
- **Proof of Work**: A computationally difficult puzzle that miners need to solve to add a block to the blockchain.
- **Node Simulation**: Although basic, the node script simulates how nodes in a decentralized network could maintain the blockchain.
